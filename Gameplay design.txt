
----Plans/ideas for Browser Adventure----


Combat system

    Weapons
        Daggers
        1h/2h Swords
        Maces
        Axes
        Bows?
        Unarmed
        Shields

    Attack styles
        Stab
        Slash
        Crush
        Accurate/Rapid for bows
        Punch/Kick for unarmed

    Changeable attack styles
        Buttons: "Stab attack" "Slash attack" etc.

    Correct attack style with correct wep = extra damage/accuracy
        e.g. Crush >> Stab with maces, Stab > Slash >> Crush with daggers

    Enemies have weaknesses vs different attack styles / weapons
        Skeletons resistant to Stab & Slash, weak to Crush
        Chainmail armor resistant to slash & crush, weak to stab and ranged
        Unarmored human weak to all

    Status effects
        Poison (x damage per turn for y turns)
        Stun (can't attack for x turns)
        Knockout with FINISH HIM button appearing? :D

    Defending
        Choose between dodge, parry, block (/w shield), nothing
        Different chances for different defense styles with different armor/weapons
            Heavy armor = dodging less likely to succeed
            1h sword/dagger = parry more likely to succeed
            Shield = able to block, chance depending of the shield material/type



Magic system

    Simple spells obtainable from quests, monster loot (e.g. Scroll of Fireball)
        Teaches you a certain spell that you can then use in Combat
            Button: Cast Fireball

        Requires Mana to use
            Mana boosting items
            Staves having unlimited casts?
            Mana regens by resting/sleeping or with potions?


Quests

    Simple fight Quests
        Monster lurks in the forest, blocking off a path
        -> go defeat it, unlocks new area

        Evil wizard occupying a tower
        -> acquire/make a key or smash the door, climb the stairs, kill wizard for loot



References to other games

    Quests to kill strigas etc.
    Dark area with a grue, needs light (lantern, torch) to pass without being eaten
